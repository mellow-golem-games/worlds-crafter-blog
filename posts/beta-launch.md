We're extremely pleased to announce that WorldsCrafter is officially in beta! After months of hardwork we're finally at a point where we feel comfortable releasing the software to the world and start gathering feedback.


## Your Feedback Is Important

With that in mind, our primary goal is to start gathering feedback from real users. We want to hear it all, the good, the bad, and the ugly. Let us know what parts of the software are working for you, and which parts aren't.
We're also looking for feedback on future features and what could make the software that much better for you. We're looking to constantly improve, and the best way to do that is find out what real users are looking for.

## Pardon The Mess

While we like to think we have a pretty talented team behind WorldsCrafter, there's bound to be issues and bugs. If you encounter any issues while using the software let us know. We'll do our best to quickly fix any issues that are brought to our attention.

That's all for now, try out the software and let us know your thoughts. We're planning on having weekly updates, at least for the first few months to rapidly push out features and bug fixes. Be on the lookout for our first update in early Febuary.
