Today we’re happy to announce the release of a long developed featured, custom encounters.
Encounters are added to sessions, and allow you to plan more in-depth sessions and keep your notes better organized. Encounters have been added to the session view, and you’ll be able to use it on all future sessions as well previous ones you’ve set up.

## The Encounters View

![Encounters View in App](https://www.worldscrafter.com/images/encounters.jpg)

Here we see the new encounters view. This is a tab in your session planning view that is available in the top section.

The encounters view will let you add as many encounters as you like, add details to each encounter (where you can link entities if needed), and add enemies. Enemies currently take a name and health which you can update/save when the session is active. This lets you track changes during combat and see which enemies are currently alive.

The goal of this is to make planning and running your sessions easier. Our end goal is to have the active session view be the only thing you need open to run your games. This ultimately brings us one step close to that goal, and gives us a solid foundation for continued development.

## Moving Forward

Our next steps for the sessions view is to continue to add features into the view itself. We want to be able to add maps to a session, and then associate encounters and party location on that map to help better visualize your session.

We also want to add more options to the encounter; the one currently being thought about is non-combat encounters. While the current implementation does allow for that, we want to make it more explicit and give additional fields to help plan out complex, non-combat scenarios your players might face.

We’re hard at work on improving both the session flow and the application as a whole. As always, if you notice any bugs, or have any suggestions for future improvements, feel free to reach out to us. We love hearing from our users, it’s what largely drives our development decisions

Until next time!
