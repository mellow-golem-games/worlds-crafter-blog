Today we’re happy to announce a large new feature that is poised to make building your worlds even better. Let’s give a warm welcome to wikis! Wikis are a brand new way to create more longer form content, and help build richer stories about your world.

## Introducing Wikis

Wikis are available as a new feature in the sidebar. They are available to all levels of membership so everyone can start using them today. Similar to other wikis, these pages give you the ability to write and view longer content detailing aspects about your world.

The first view you’ll see is the base wiki view where you’ll be able to create folders and documents.

This helps keep your wikis organized and lets you set up the structure that makes sense for your world. Folders and documents are both editable by right-clicking them.

Wikis bring with them all the core features from our standard editor, including the ability to link wikis together. This allows you to create a flow through your world and lets you explore solely from the wikis page.

## Exploring Wikis

Wikis also come with a view option allowing you to jump right into the wikis without all the extra overhead the editor brings. We’re working on allowing this to be configurable to be public, allowing you to share your world with a wider audience.

The explore view also includes all the links you’ve created, so you’ll be able to move through wiki documents in this view.

As of right now, views are fairly limited, but we’re working to improve them by adding more features like embeddable images and maps.

## Coming Up Next

As mentioned above, we’re working on building public viewing of your wikis. Along with that, we’re also looking at adding more permissions controls to the various entities and wikis to help give you more options of what you do and don’t share.

Lastly, we’re super excited to officially announce that work has begun on multi-user world functionality. This will allow you to invite collaborators to your project so that you can build together. This goes hand in hand with the advanced permissions we’re working on, so you can invite people and give them only access to what you want. Stay tuned for that, we’re anticipating the first version will be released by the end of August.
