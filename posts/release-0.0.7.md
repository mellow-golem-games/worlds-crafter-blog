A quick update today, but one we’re really excited about. Our latest work has been around the map builder, and adds some new features to help build richer maps.


## More Map Markers

The first change is we’ve added some additional map markers for towns and cities. These are the first of many, and should help give some more variety to your maps. Of course, the existing pin is still an option.


## Map Labels

In addition to labels, markers now have the ability to be a label as well. These will display the text of the pin instead of a marker. This further increases the ability to customize your maps to fit your needs and make them easier to read.

While this is a small update, it involved a lot of work behind the scenes to set up these systems. Moving forward, we’ll be able to add more marker types and provide additional customization options easier. With that said, if anyone has any additional marker needs let us know! We’re looking for any feedback on this change, and suggestions for future improvements.

Until next time!
