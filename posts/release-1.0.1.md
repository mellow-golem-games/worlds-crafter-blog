With the new year already nearly two months in we're happy to announce our first update of 2023. For this update, we took a look at the timeline component and started making some additions to make it easier to use.

## A Fresh Coat Of Paint

Our first goal was to make the visuals a bit better. We made some subtle changes in colors that should make a big difference, along with adding some new elements to make it easier to follow.

As part of this, we took a hard look at how this part of the app functions on mobile and made some changes. This should make it easier and quicker to make your timelines regardless of which device you do so on.

## Auto-scrolling on Date Change

One of the features of the timeline is that it will automatically sort as you change the dates on items. Unfortunately, this led to cards being moved around as you were working on them which was confusing, to say the least.

Kiss those problems goodbye. In the latest release, it will now also scroll you to the proper card as it changes the order. This should make it much easier to manage your timelines, especially as they grow large.

## Handle Improper Inputs

We also changed the date input to properly discard and warn the user against non-number values. This is a small quality-of-life improvement that should make it a bit easier to see what's happening. We're also working on a long-term proposal to allow specifically set values in addition to numbers for this like B.C or A.D but tailored to your world.

## What's Next?

We've been silent for a while but we're looking to change that in a big way this year. We have a full roadmap that should take us to at least the middle of the year, and a backlog of additional items after that. We're working this week to produce a more robust walkthrough of what features we're looking to implement this year. There are big things in store, and we're super excited to be able to share that will you all soon.

Be on the lookout for that in the next week or so, along with the next batch of release items. Until then!
