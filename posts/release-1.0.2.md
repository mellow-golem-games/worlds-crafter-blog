Welcome back to another dev update. This time around we have a slew of small fixes along with some much-needed work to our custom entities feature. We’re very happy to have these new updates out, and everything you’ll read about is now live for you to try out.

## Custom Entities

Our first update is a large one to the custom entities feature. For those that don’t know, custom entities allow you to create your own entities (like characters and locations) that are customized to your campaign.

During this, we completely revamped the design to make the whole process of creating and editing easier to do. We also added some new features like making a description by default and adding a rich text editor for each entity.

Overall, this update should make custom entities much easier to work with. We’re planning some additional changes in the near future, so stay tuned for those.

## Other Fixes

In addition to the custom entity work, we also had a variety of smaller fixes that touch other parts of the app. Here’s a list of what you can expect to see fixed:

- Fixed an issue where the rich text editor had white text on a white background
- Fixed linking in sessions
- Old custom entities will no longer break suggestions
- Added an image next to pin type selector in map builder
- Added a darken effect to selected label/pin type in map builder
- Setup error handling and tracking to help debug production issues
- Added images to inventory where applicable
- Fixed a number of minor console errors
- Fixed an issue where editing a custom entity would show the previously selected one

## What’s Next

Our next project is a brand new feature where we’ll be adding random generators to the application. This will let you quickly spin up characters, locations, and more right from in the app with the parameters of your choosing. We’re planning to roll out characters first, and then progressively add more. Expect the first version of this to be released in the next 2 weeks!

Until next time,

The WorldsCrafter Team
