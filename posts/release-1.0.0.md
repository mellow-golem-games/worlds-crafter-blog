We are incredibly excited to announce the newest, and long awaited feature of the Worlds Crafter application; custom entities! This feature is now live on the site, and we couldn’t be more excited for our users to be able to try it out.

## Custom Entities

Worlds Crafter initially launched with a handful of prebuilt entities like characters and locations, but this is a bit limiting. With custom entities, you’ll be able to create your own types of content, and tap into the rich functionality available to the prebuilt ones.
 
Custom entities is a new item available on the sidebar. There you’ll be able to create, edit, and delete your custom entities. In the UI you’ll be able to assign whatever fields you’d like, as well as add extras like the timelines and attributes.
 
While the feature is live it is still an early work in progres. We have several upcoming additions planned like adding images and more customization. Stay tuned!

## Moving Forward

Our next big project is a complete redesign of the application. We’ve brought on a true designer, and they’ve gone through and made suggestions on how we can improve the UI. Over the next week or so we’ll be making those changes as well as adding additional improvements to make the application easier to use than before.

That’s all for now, stay tuned for future updates.
