Welcome everyone to the secodn offical release of Worlds Crafter. This release sees a number of bug fixes that should hopefully help make the application easier to use.

## Mobile Fixes

Some of the more noticeable changes come with a re-work of some of the functioanlity in mobile. This mainly focuses on switching between views and how the mobile slide out menu works. These changes aim at making navigating the site on mobile devices much easier and quicker.

Being mobile friendly is a big goal for us moving foward, and we're always looking for ways to improve. We'll continue to evaulate how the software works on mobile devices, and as always welcome any feedback that can help us improve.


## General Bug Fixes

In addition to our dedicated mobile fixes, we also dealt with a number of issues related to various parts of the application:

- Fixed and issue where campaigns wouldn't load if your session expired.
- Fixed an issue where sometimes editing an entity wouldn't populate the fields correctly.
- Fixed adding/deleting points of interest in the map builder
- Added new text when editing entities
- Fixed an issued with players descriptions that would crash the app
- Added a back to sessions link when a session is active to make navigation easier.

We're constantly on the look out for bugs like these, and encourage you to let us know if you find any.
That's all for this update, hopefully with the app should be easier to use and have less issues. Stay tuned for next week where we'll be dropping our next content update.
