Welcome back to another dev update. Today, we look at a couple of big changes we’ve made over the past two weeks. These changes bring limited upfront changes but are foundations that we will be building extra features off of in the future.

## Random Generators

The first update we have is the release of random generators. You’ll find the first of these, Characters, located in a new section in the sidebar.

Here, you’ll be able to quickly generate a random character based on a handful of options. Or, you can leave them as “any” for a completely random character.

Once you generate the character, you’ll also be able to save it to your campaign/world. They will then appear in your “Characters” table under the tab of the same name in the sidebar. Of course, once they’re added, you’ll be able to tweak them however you want and add more attributes to them.

With this addition, you’ll be able to quickly fill out your world with characters, or come up with on the fly in-game. Moving forward, we’ll be adding more generators to help you fill out more aspects of your world.

## New Editor

We’ve also released a new rich text editor for all the areas of our app that support it. This is a small change from a UI perspective but allows us much more customization options in the future.

We’ve also been careful to make the new editor backward compatible with the old one. You should be able to see all your old data present with styles intact in the new editor. If you run into any issues, reach out to support and we can help recover your data.

## What’s Next?

As we hinted above, we’re looking at rolling out a few more random generators over the next few weeks. Be on the lookout for those soon.

We’re also looking at a rework of the map editor. We think the current version is a nice start, but still has a long way to go. One area we want to tackle is making the maps more interactive and explorable. Being able to link maps to maps and having them open to each other is one idea to help make your world connected. There’s much more than that, expect that release in the next 2 weeks. next 2 weeks.

Until next time!
