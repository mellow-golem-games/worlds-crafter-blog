Today we’re happy to announce two new features, and the first features requested by actual users of the app! These are big additions that should hopefully make it easier to build and manage your worlds.

## Tagging and Filter

The first update is the addition of tags to the majority of entities in the system. This gives you the ability to quickly categorize your entities, and adds an additional level of filtering to your world. Coupled with this, we’ve added a filter input to the main entity table view. Type here will filter out the table based on any tags as well as the titles and display those records which contain the filter terms. These features are a big step forward in being able to manage larger worlds, and we’re looking forward to improving them in the future.

## Adhoc Entity Creation

The other major addition is the ability to add adhoc entities while creating others. Previously, if you wanted to link two entities (adding a location or race to character for example), you would have to have the second entity already created. This created a flow that would force you to jump between entity types and create hard requirements for the order in which you create them. Now, if you want to add an entity that doesn’t exist, you’ll be given the option to add it. Then, once you save the entity you’re currently working on it the system will save any new ones that you linked to it. You can then go back and add details to these new entities whenever you see fit. This fix should make the flow of creating multiple entities that much easier, and reduce the need to context switch. 

## Bug Fixes

As always, we also included some general bug fixes in this release. The biggest one fixes an issue where sometimes trying to edit an entity would crash the app. This was most apparent in Chrome. 

That’s it for today’s release, let us know how the updates are working and please let us know if you notice any issues or have suggestions. Until next time!
