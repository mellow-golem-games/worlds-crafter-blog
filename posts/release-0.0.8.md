We are pleased to announce the newest release of Worlds Crafter is now live! In this release, we add additional functionality to session encounters which should make it easier to run your games and keep track of combat.

## The New Encounter Builder

This update is all about encounters and making them more useful. The core update adds an initiative field to all enemies in an encounter, and will automatically sort them based on this.

## Encounter Modal Example

As you can see, it also pulls in players associated with a campaign to help you see a full view of your combat. You also have the option to remove players on a per combat basis should a specific player not be involved.

The goal here was to make combat more seamless, and prevent you from having to track initiative and enemy health in a separate location. This should hopefully make running your games that much easier.

It also adds a new active encounter modal which helps cut down on the clutter so you can focus on your game. This also gives us a space to add additional features in the future.

## Future Improvements

While this is a relatively small change, it gives us a good foundation to continue building out encounters to make them more involved. Some of our upcoming ideas are:

- Settings to remove players from all encounters
- Additional fields to track enemy abilities and spells
- Grouped initiative
- Encounter templates to make building them quicker
- Non-combat encounters


We’re currently prioritizing these additions, so if any of them are something you’d like to see sonner let us know. We always look for feedback from our users, so let us know what you like or don’t like about this update and our future ideas. Your feedback helps shape our development priorities!That’s all for now, check back next week where we will be releasing the long awaited custom entities feature!
