Welcome everyone to the first official update of Worlds Crafter! We're super excited to have our first official release out the door, and looking forward to many more in the future. This release comes with some general bug fixes, as well as two new pieces of functionality.

## Religion/Beliefs Entity

First off, we have a new religions or beliefs entity that can has been added as an option in the sidebar. Here, you'll be able to setup any religious beliefs that are found throughout your world.

We're also looking for new ways to integrate this with existing entities. For the timebeing, you can link a city with a religious belief, but we'll be expanding this in the future to make it more versitile.

## Timeline Builder

We've also added a new timeline builder to most entities. This allows you to easily create a visual representation of the history of a particular entity. This initial version gives you the ability to links details to your timeline events, and will also automatically sort by dates.

We have plans to flesh this out further in the future, including building custom rules for how dates are sorted (such as having things like B.C and A.D) as well as general UI Improvements.

## Future Plans

Our goal moving foward is to continue with consistent, smaller updates like this. Each week we'd like to release new features and keep continually improving the Worlds Crafter Experience. If you have any suggestions please reach out to us! We build what our users want and always take in all feedback, both positive and negitive. Look forward to another release in the next week. Until next time!
